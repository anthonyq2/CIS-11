- [ ] 2.1.5 Section Review, Questions 1,2,3,4 and 5
1. The CPU contains registers, a frequency clock, a control unit, and an arithmetic logic unit.
2. The CPU is connected to the rest of the computer with the data bus, control bus, and the address bus.
3. Memory access takes more machine cycles because reading a single value from memory takes 4 steps: placing the address you want to read 
on the bus, asserting the processor's RD pin, waiting one clock cycle for the memory chips to respond, and copying the data from the data 
bus into the destination operand.
